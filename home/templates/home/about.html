                        Brendan began conducting his running classes in the mall back in 2010.
                        The initiative started as a couch to 5K program organized by Longford Sports Partnership.
                        After the six-week program concluded, most participants wanted to keep running,
                        which led to the creation of Brendan Doyle Running.
                        Some of those early runners are still with us today. As the classes grew in size,
                        Madeline stepped in to assist with the beginners.
                        Currently, we offer everything from couch to 5K to full marathon training and everything in between.
                        Most of our classes align with the school year, but we have one that runs year-round for more advanced runners.
                        Every Saturday morning, we organize a long run that accommodates all levels, sometimes with up to 5 different pace groups.
                        Over the years, we’ve also coached many other clubs.
