# Brendan Doyle Running Club

## Introduction

  - Welcome to the Brendan Doyle Running Club. I have designed this website for my local running club in Co. Longford, Ireland. The website provides information regarding classes, locations, events, and a contact page. The website also provides a members area where approved members can securly access downloadable training routes (.gpx), as well as upload their own favorite routes to share amongst the members. Users can also enter the annual Royal Canal Run event which has distances from 10k up to 53k Ultramarathon.
  - This is my fourth project on the Full-Stack Developer course with the Code Institute, and focuses on Django frameworks, Bootstrap, Database Managment, Agile Methodologies, and CRUD functionality.

## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration

- I wanted to create a website which contained all of the information that a new visitor to the site would want to see, so I included information about the club and it's goals, where and when the classes are held, a contact form for further queries, and entry to the annual race event. The race event is for the general public, not just for club members.
- I also wanted to create a members area where members must be approved before having access to any of the members material, primarily to the gpx file download feature. the gpx files contain routes that have been created by the club for training purposes, or saved routes from members runs. These files incorporate CRUD functionality for the uploader, but are only downloadable by other members. Once downloaded, the gpx files can be synced with other software like strava, garmin, Coros etc., and the course information can be accessed showing the distance, elevation and terrain of the run. The route can be followed in real-time on supported devices. 

#### Colour Scheme

#### Epic - Members Area
- As a user I can register with the club so that I can access a members area that is not accessible by non-members, and subject to verification.
- As a member I can log into my account so that I can download gpx routes in the members area.

#### Epic - Members Profiles
- As a logged-in member I can view my personal profile so that I can view, edit & delete my account details.

#### Epic - Race Event Entry
- As a user I can view events so that I can book in for a race event.

#### Epic - Contact Us
- As a user I can contact the club so that I can have any further questions answered.
